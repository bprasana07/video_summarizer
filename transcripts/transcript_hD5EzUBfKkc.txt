for all everyone who's trying to build something in AI. Do you think opportunity still exists? Uh aside from like everyone's building a JPT rapper, right? Uh do you still there's still opportunity for that or people should switch and what are the areas that they should be looking after? >> Realistically, it's gotten much harder. Yes, like you you would want to build a GPD wrapper because building your own model is like basically way harder. It's almost impossible for >> it was impossible and and I don't even think people should be looking at it as like building a model once. That that's the mistake everybody made. It's whoever tried to build models around the time we started. I was like, "Yeah, how much does it cost to launch?" I even had an investor who now went to Meta and he's like, "Oh, it's going to cost $200,000 to train a GP3 model. So, why can't you do it? I'll I'll give you like uh a million and you spend 200k on the model." Like, it it's it's not about like that one model. It's about that relentless exercise of iterating the models, building the next cluster, hiring the talent to go figure out like what the next model should be and continually iterating, bringing down the cost, improving the capabilities, improving the reasoning, all that stuff. That requires a lab and a cluster and the people and the uh milestones and like some way to like uh actually turn all those models into like a product and and a business and revenue and then you end up basically like saying oh you have to build another then what what are you like why do you need to exist like okay where is the talent arbitrage so uh that's why I think product is actually at least you know a little more statistically probable Uh but even there you have to compete with the likes of the labs themselves which are building their own products >> and the big tech companies and like upstars like us and and no one's going to be like oh Perplexi is just going to do uh research I can go do the commerce stuff. >> No like perplexities in commerce. >> Exactly right. Like everyone's building horizontal products and and and that applies to us too. Oh ch will never do shopping. Chat will never do travel. Uh it won't do finance. All that is like not true. like everyone's going to do anything that works. >> So I I would just say the bet you can make is do what you truly are obsessed about because uh fundamentally it's a bet on yourself. >> It's not a bet on the market. It's not a bet on um ecosystem like what competitors will do will not do. Like don't try to be this uh whiteboard uh strategy master like it it's completely pointless. like when your idea works and and gets like 100 million or like billion in revenue, always expect existing people to go after it because everyone's looking for that incremental revenue in AI because the capex is so high. So the only way to justify all this is to actually turn that into like business profits >> and then so they'll go after you. So the only thing you can bet on is whether you're so obsessed about a topic that you will do it anyway regardless all the odds stacked against you and then you'll prove the world wrong because you go so far deep into that and and no one cared about the problem more than you did. And for us like for me like that's why the whole you know you asked me what my most important trait is like I love learning and and um this is one of the best apps for learning. It's designed for us. It's designed for our founders like we built it for ourselves. key bet was everybody in the world loves everybody in the world loves having an AI that they can summon to go do stuff for them. Everybody wants more time in their lives. So I think uh build for yourself. Hopefully uh that's a thing that a lot of people in the world want and therefore you can turn it into a scalable product and and and a scalable company >> and get acquired at the stage I
