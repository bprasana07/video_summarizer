In this podcast episode, Richard Sutton, a pioneer in reinforcement learning (RL) and recipient of the Turing Award, discusses the differences between RL and large language models (LLMs) in AI. Key points include:

1. **Reinforcement Learning vs. LLMs**: Sutton argues that RL focuses on understanding the world and learning from experience, while LLMs primarily mimic human language without a true understanding of the world or goals. He emphasizes that RL has a clear definition of what constitutes a "right" action based on rewards.

2. **World Models**: Sutton challenges the notion that LLMs possess robust world models, asserting that they lack the ability to predict real-world outcomes and do not learn from direct experience. Instead, they learn from patterns in data without a grounding in actual events.

3. **Goals and Intelligence**: He posits that intelligence is fundamentally about achieving goals, which LLMs do not possess. Sutton believes that without goals, LLMs cannot be considered intelligent in the same way RL agents can be.

4. **Learning from Experience**: Sutton advocates for a continual learning approach where agents learn from their interactions with the environment, contrasting this with LLMs that rely on pre-existing data. He argues that true intelligence involves adapting and learning from real-world experiences.

5. **Future of AI**: Sutton expresses skepticism about the long-term viability of LLMs as foundational for future AI development. He believes that systems capable of learning from experience will ultimately outperform those reliant on human knowledge and imitation.

6. **Cultural Evolution and Learning**: The discussion touches on how humans learn through imitation and experience, with Sutton emphasizing that while imitation plays a role, the core of learning is trial-and-error and prediction.

7. **Concerns about AI Succession**: Sutton discusses the inevitability of AI succession and the potential for both positive and negative outcomes. He stresses the importance of instilling robust values in AI systems to ensure they act in beneficial ways.

8. **Design vs. Replication**: He highlights a significant transition in intelligence from biological replication to designed entities, suggesting that future AIs will be designed with a deeper understanding of intelligence.

Overall, the conversation underscores the fundamental differences between RL and LLMs, the importance of goals in intelligence, and the potential future trajectories of AI development.
